# kinwove — Claude Code handover

This file is the entry point for a new Claude Code session picking up work on
this project. Read it first, top to bottom.

---

## 🚫 GOLDEN RULE — READ THIS BEFORE TOUCHING ANY FILE

**Do not change anything that Daniel did not explicitly ask you to change in this conversation.**

This means:
- **No "while I'm in here" cleanups.** If Daniel asks to fix a button color, fix only that button. Do not rename variables, reformat JSX, adjust spacing, or touch adjacent code.
- **No visual "improvements."** Do not adjust padding, font sizes, colors, border radii, shadows, line heights, letter spacing, or layout unless Daniel names that exact property and says to change it.
- **No refactoring.** Do not extract components, rename props, consolidate styles, or restructure logic unless asked.
- **No adding comments or removing comments** unless asked.
- **No dependency updates** unless asked.
- **No "fixing" things that look wrong to you.** If something looks off but Daniel didn't mention it, leave it. He may have put it there intentionally, or already gone through iterations to land there.
- **No changing component defaults** — props, fallback values, default styles — unless the change was explicitly requested.

**The rule is: surgical.** Touch only what was named. Nothing else.

If you are editing a file for one reason and you notice something unrelated that looks wrong, mention it in text — do not fix it silently.

### Except: something BROKEN gets fixed (Daniel, 19 Oct 2026)

The rule protects how kinwove looks, reads and is built. It does not protect bugs. If something is actually broken (an error, a crash, a job that fails, data that does not save, a security hole), fix it, prove the fix works, and tell Daniel what was broken and what you changed. Fix only the broken thing: everything around it stays surgical.

If you are not sure whether it is broken or just looks odd to you, treat it as looking odd: mention it, do not change it.

Example: the nightly backup made hundreds of requests with no retry and ended in failure on most days from August to October 2026. That is broken, so it was fixed (`scripts/fetch-retry.mjs`).

## ⚠️ LOCKED — DO NOT CHANGE WITHOUT EXPLICIT INSTRUCTION

**KinwoveStar path:** `M12 1 L13.4 9.6 L22 11 L13.4 12.4 L12 23 L10.6 12.4 L2 11 L10.6 9.6 Z`
**KinwoveStar viewBox:** `0 0 24 24`
**KinwoveWordmark star container:** `width: '0.28em'`, `height: '0.28em'`, `top: '-0.72em'` (component defaults — do not change)
**KinwoveWordmark in AppHeader + MobileHeader (App.jsx):** `size={32} starEm={0.38}` — locked 2026-06-08. Do not change starEm in either header call site.
**KinwoveWordmark dotless-i:** The wordmark always renders `ı` (U+0131, dotless-i) for the "i" in "kinwove" so the star sits clean above it. Do not replace with a regular `i`.

These values were approved and confirmed correct on 2026-06-08. Do not touch these values for any reason unless Daniel explicitly says "change the star." Do not infer from screenshots, do not "improve" it, do not adjust proportions.

**Star icon rule (locked 2026-05-26):** Never use the `✦` Unicode character as a visible UI icon. All star icons in JSX must use `<KinwoveStar size={N} />` from `src/components/brand/KinwoveStar.jsx`. The `✦` character is only acceptable inside plain strings (email HTML, prompts, non-rendered text). Do not revert this without explicit instruction.

---

## ⚠️ FIXED BUGS — DO NOT REVERT

These bugs were fixed on 2026-05-26 after painful debugging. Read before touching any of these areas.

### 1. Supabase `.catch()` is not a function
**Never** chain `.catch(() => {})` on a Supabase query builder. Use `.then(null, () => {})` or `await` with try/catch instead. The Supabase query builder is thenable but has no `.catch()` method — it will crash the app with a blank screen.

### 2. Profile table has NO `first_name` / `last_name` columns
The profiles table only has `display_name` (text). Profile.jsx splits `display_name` into `first_name`/`last_name` **in the UI only** for the form, then joins them back on save. Never query for `first_name` or `last_name` from Supabase — the columns don't exist and the query will 400.

The save logic: `display_name = [form.first_name.trim(), form.last_name.trim()].filter(Boolean).join(' ')`

### 3. Profile Save button — correct disabled check
The profile edit form state has `first_name` and `last_name` keys, NOT `display_name`. The Save button must check:
```js
disabled={saving || !form.first_name.trim()}
```
Never check `!form.display_name` — it's undefined in the edit form state.

### 4. Pastor prompt `isFirstTime` check
The pastor onboarding prompt logic in App.jsx must check `!profile?.is_pastor`, NOT `!pastorChurchId`. Checking `!pastorChurchId` incorrectly blocks the prompt for users who have a church but whose church roles haven't loaded yet:
```js
const isFirstTime = profileEditOrigin === 'idle' && !pendingPastorApply && !profile?.is_pastor;
```

### 5. Invite code rotation — always use the server endpoint
`rotateCode()` in `PeoplePanel` (ChurchAdmin.jsx) uses `POST /api/church/rotate-invite-code` (service role, bypasses RLS). Never revert this to a direct Supabase `.update()` call — RLS will block it. The token must use `session?.access_token` first (prop), with `getSession()` as fallback:
```js
const token = session?.access_token ?? (await supabase.auth.getSession())?.data?.session?.access_token;
```

### 6. Invite code lookup — always use the server endpoint
`GET /api/church/by-invite-code?code=X` (service role). Never do a direct Supabase query for invite codes — RLS blocks it for non-members of non-public/pending churches.

### 7. Sermon composer — NOT a fixed overlay
The SermonComposer is rendered as the **Sermons tab** inside ChurchModeShell (`tab === 'sermons'` in ChurchAdmin.jsx), with `embedded={true}`. It is NOT a `position:fixed; inset:0; zIndex:300` overlay — that pattern was removed because it covered the sidebar (zIndex:100). Do not reintroduce the overlay. The tab is defined in ChurchModeShell.jsx TABS array (🎙 Sermons).

Entry points that open sermons must navigate to `church-admin` with `tab='sermons'`:
- `openSermonInComposer(id)` → `setTab('sermons')` (inside ChurchAdmin)
- `onNewSermon` callback from ChurchPage → `setPastorAdminInitialTab('sermons'); setStage('church-admin')`
- `stage === 'sermon-composer'` redirect in App.jsx → same as above

### 8. SermonAiNudge — only show when running low
`SermonAiNudge` in `PlanGate.jsx` must only render when remaining uses are low (≤10 for trial, ≤1 for free). Do not show the count when the user has plenty of uses. Do not add a persistent counter anywhere in the UI.

### 9. ChurchModeShell tabs (current, locked)
```
Overview | People | Ask | Bible | 🎙 Sermons | Settings
```
Sermons was added 2026-05-26. Do not remove it. `fullBleed` is only for the Bible tab.

### 10. Admin email branding
The DB trigger `notify_admin_pastor_application` in Supabase sends emails via Resend. It must use kinwove branding — subject line `kinwove — New pastor application: ...`, no ✦ in subject. If you see "The Way" anywhere in emails, the trigger needs to be re-run with the updated SQL (see scripts/).

### 11. Sermon discussion display names
`SermonDiscussion.jsx` only fetches `id, display_name` from profiles (no first_name/last_name columns). Fallback is `'Someone'`. The display_name is populated on profile creation from the wizard.

### 12. `stage === 'sermon-composer'` is effectively dead
This App.jsx stage now immediately redirects to `church-admin` with `pastorAdminInitialTab = 'sermons'`. Don't add new rendering logic to it.

### 13. Church post attribution — "by [person]" sub-line (ADDED 2026-05-26)
When `showAsChurch` is true (church-scoped post shown under the church name), the timestamp sub-line in `PostCard.jsx` shows `"1h · by [authorProfile.display_name]"`. This is the intended Facebook-groups-style attribution. Do not remove it.
```jsx
{showAsChurch && !item.is_anonymous && authorProfile?.display_name && (
  <> · by {authorProfile.display_name}</>
)}
```
`authorProfile` is passed from `authorMap` in `Feed.jsx` — non-anonymous author IDs are always hydrated. The Community.jsx inline PostCard does NOT use this (it only shows personal/public posts, no church scope).

### 14. FB-style comment modal (PostCard.jsx — ADDED 2026-05-26)
Comments open as a fixed overlay modal (zIndex: 400) with backdrop click to close. Do NOT revert to inline expansion. Sermon items (`item.source === 'sermon_item'`) render `<SermonDiscussion>` inside the modal; regular posts render `<Comments>`. The modal header shows `"{displayName}'s post"`.

### 15. Notification deep-link to comments (ADDED 2026-05-26)
`App.jsx` has `openCommentPostId` state. When a notification with `target_type='post'` or `type='post_comment'` is tapped, it sets `openCommentPostId = n.target_id` and navigates to feed. This is threaded through to `Community.jsx` and `Feed.jsx` as the `openCommentPostId` prop, then to each `PostCard` as `defaultCommentsOpen={openCommentPostId === item.id}`. Do not break this chain.

### 16. Reaction + comment counts (PostCard.jsx — ADDED 2026-05-26)
PostCard.jsx action bar (UPDATED 2026-05-29): **icon-only reactions** — no text label on reaction buttons. Count badge appears next to the icon only when > 0. `title` attribute = label (tooltip). Comment button shows count when > 0, "Comment" text when 0. All on one row, no flexWrap.
Stats summary line above the border: `🙏❤️ N · M comments · K views` — small gray, only renders when there's data.

### 17. Church search shows ALL public churches (FIXED 2026-05-26)
`ChurchDirectory.jsx` no longer filters by `verification_status = 'verified'`. All `is_public=true` churches appear in search regardless of verification status. Do not re-add the verified filter.

### 18. New churches default to `is_public=true` (FIXED 2026-05-26)
`/api/church/submit-unverified` in server.js sets `is_public: true`. The old `is_public: false` hid all self-reported churches from search and broke invite codes. Do not revert.

### 19. PostCard author names are clickable (ADDED 2026-05-26)
Avatar and name in `src/PostCard.jsx` call `onViewProfile?.(item.author_id)` on click. `Feed.jsx` accepts and passes `onViewProfile` to PostCard. `ChurchPage.jsx` passes `onViewProfile` into Feed. Anonymous posts stay non-clickable.

### 20. Connect screen is live (ADDED 2026-05-26)
`ConnectScreen.jsx` renders at `stage === 'connect'`. Both Community instances in App.jsx pass `onOpenConnect={() => setStage('connect')}`. Do NOT set it back to `undefined`. The screen shows members with `mentor_open=true` or `connect_open=true`.

### 21. DB columns added 2026-05-26 (run in prod)
```sql
-- profiles
alter table public.profiles
  add column if not exists mentor_open boolean default false,
  add column if not exists connect_open boolean default false,
  add column if not exists allow_friend_requests boolean default true,
  add column if not exists allow_follows boolean default true;

-- sermon discussions image support
alter table public.sermon_discussions
  add column if not exists image_urls text[] default '{}';

-- poll votes
create table if not exists public.poll_votes (
  post_id uuid not null references public.posts(id) on delete cascade,
  user_id uuid not null references public.profiles(id) on delete cascade,
  option_index integer not null,
  created_at timestamptz not null default now(),
  primary key (post_id, user_id)
);
```

### 22. Autofocus on comment inputs (ADDED 2026-05-26)
`Comments.jsx` textarea has `autoFocus`. `SermonDiscussion.jsx` uses `useRef` + `useEffect` to focus textarea whenever `replyTo` changes or the discussion opens. Community.jsx reply input already had `autoFocus`. Do not remove these.

### 23. SermonDiscussion avatars (ADDED 2026-05-26)
Profiles query fetches `avatar_config, avatar_url`. `Bubble` component renders `<Avatar size={30} />` beside each commenter's name. Anonymous posts get a neutral dot placeholder.

### 24. SermonDiscussion multiple replies (FIXED 2026-05-26)
Reply button shows at ALL depths (removed `depth === 0` gate). After posting, calls `reload()` instead of optimistic append so `profMap` is populated and names show correctly (not "Someone").

### 25. Prayer.jsx — NO photo upload code (FIXED 2026-05-27)
`personal_prayers` table has no `image_urls` column. All photo upload code was removed from Prayer.jsx — do NOT re-add `PostImageGrid`, `useImageDrafts`, `ImageDraftGrid`, `ImageAttachButton`, or `image_urls` to any prayer insert. Saves will fail with a 400 if you include that column.

### 26. Prayer Pulse — no `category` column (FIXED 2026-05-27)
`personal_prayers` has no `category` column. Do NOT query it. The Pulse now queries `is_public=true` prayers joined to `profiles!user_id(church_id, display_name)`, filtered to the pastor's church. Shows snippets + member name + Pray button.

### 27. walk_steps RLS — INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE policies needed (ADDED 2026-05-27)
`walk_steps` previously had SELECT only. Walk saves were blocked. Added policies via `scripts/2026-05-27-walk-steps-rls.sql` — run in Supabase SQL editor if not already applied. Keyed on `walks.created_by = auth.uid()` via subquery.

### 28. Nav stage persistence — 300ms debounce + mobile flush (FIXED 2026-05-27)
`App.jsx`: DB debounce reduced to 300ms. Added `visibilitychange` + `pagehide` listeners to flush `last_stage` immediately when tab goes hidden. Walk page and all major stages now restore correctly after mobile tab recycling.

### 29. Sermon discussion question-first format (LOCKED 2026-05-27)
`SERMON_SYSTEM` prompt generates `body` field as: question first (ends `?`), blank line, 2–3 context sentences. PostCard (`sermon_item`) renders the leading `?` paragraph as the hero at top (17px bold serif). Legacy fallback for old posts (last line ending `?`). Do not revert to context-before-question ordering.

### 30. feed_items view — body_data merges into body (CRITICAL)
The `feed_items` Postgres view merges `body_data` into `body`:
```sql
coalesce(p.body_data, '{}'::jsonb) || jsonb_build_object('text', p.body) as body
```
`item.body_data` is ALWAYS undefined in PostCard — the view doesn't return it. All structured fields (walk_id, walk_title, is_walk_announcement, sermon_id, etc.) are on `item.body`. The `posts.body` column is plain `text` — NEVER insert an object there; structured data goes in `body_data jsonb`.

### 31. Walk announcement card (ADDED 2026-05-27)
PostCard renders a "🚶 New Walk" card when `item.body?.is_walk_announcement || item.body?.walk_id`. Fields are `item.body.walk_emoji`, `item.body.walk_title`, `item.body.walk_id`. `onPickWalk` prop chains Feed → ChurchPage → `onOpenWalks`.

### 33. Featured walk shows on Sermons tab too (ADDED 2026-05-27)
`ChurchPage.jsx`: `featuredWalk` card rendered on Sermons tab (below latest sermon, above series) for members + pastor. Same style as Feed tab card. Both tabs show it — Feed and Sermons.

### 34. Milestones wired to walk completions (ADDED 2026-05-27)
`Walks.jsx` `handleAdvance`: on final day completion, fire-and-forget `posts.insert` with `kind: 'journey_milestone'`, `scope: 'me'`, body = `Finished "${title}" — N-day walk.` Do not block the view transition.

### 35. PlanLine hidden until Stripe live (2026-05-27)
`MePanel.jsx` `<PlanLine>` is commented out — `/?upgrade=1` has no handler. Do NOT uncomment until the Stripe individual upgrade flow exists.

### 32. ChurchAttendsCard — no sermon row (FIXED 2026-05-27)
`profileShared.jsx` `ChurchAttendsCard` no longer shows the "This week" sermon row. Church content doesn't belong on personal profile. Card redesigned: parchment bg, `rgba(184,115,58,0.2)` border, serif church name. Do not re-add the sermon row.

### 36. ChurchPage Pray tab (ADDED 2026-05-28)
Congregation prayers live in their own "🙏 Pray" tab between Sermons and Info. Members + pastors only. Full prayer text, Pray/Prayed buttons (`personal_prayer_support`), empty state. "Pray together" chip on Feed navigates to this tab. Prayer fetch returns ALL church member prayers (no slice limit).

### 37. church_roles write RLS — SECURITY DEFINER (FIXED 2026-05-28)
INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE policies on `church_roles` used a self-referential subquery → infinite recursion. Fix: `public.church_roles_is_manager(uuid)` SECURITY DEFINER function. All write policies call this function. Script: `scripts/2026-05-27-fix-church-roles-write-rls.sql`. Do not revert to inline subquery.

### 38. Role assignment notification (ADDED 2026-05-28)
DB trigger `trg_notify_role_granted` fires on `church_roles` INSERT. Uses `add_notification()` helper — `kind='role_assigned'`, `data={church_id, role_key, role_label, church_name}`. Skips owner rows + self-assign. Script: `scripts/2026-05-27-notify-role-granted.sql`. Notification tap (App.jsx): care team → await loadChurchRoles then setStage('care-inbox'); other roles → church page.

### 39. Care team role → auto care_team_members (ADDED 2026-05-28)
`grantRole()` in ChurchAdmin upserts to `care_team_members` when `role_key='care'`. DB trigger `trg_sync_care_role_insert` also does this. Both run. `care-inbox` stage gate: `careTeamRecord || profile?.church_id` (loosened to avoid race on notification tap).

### 40. Role title on posts + comments (ADDED 2026-05-28)
`src/PostCard.jsx`: top role shown as gold text in subline — "Care team · 2h · in Grace Church". `presetForRole` imported. Same pattern in `Comments.jsx` and `SermonDiscussion.jsx`. Replaced pill `<BadgeList>` in name row.

### 41. DM notifications (ADDED 2026-05-28)
DB trigger `trg_notify_dm_message` on `dm_messages` INSERT sends notification to other participant. `kind='dm_message'`, `data={snippet, conversation_id}`. Script: `scripts/2026-05-28-dm-notifications.sql`. App.jsx tap → fetch other profile, open conversation directly. `MessagesInbox` ThreadRow shows gold unread dot + bold name when `lastMsg.sender_id !== session.user.id`.

### 42. Invite card — QR + Email/Text/Print (ADDED 2026-05-28)
`ChurchAdmin.jsx` PeoplePanel invite card: QR code (quickchart.io, 120×120) inline, ✉️ Email (mailto: pre-filled), 💬 Text (sms:), 🖨️ Print (new window styled HTML + QR). `qrUrl()` function defined at top of ChurchAdmin.jsx — always reuse it.

## 1. Who you're working with

**Daniel Kalawarny** (dkalawarny@hotmail.com).
- Recent convert to Christianity. The product is informed by his own journey
  from skeptic → seeker → believer.
- First-time founder. Not a developer — understands product well but needs
  **concrete, copy-pasteable next steps**. Hand him the exact command or SQL.
- Communicates in short, casual messages. Mirror that energy. Skip preamble.
- Move fast, ship rough, polish on round 2.
- **Don't ask permission for obvious cleanups** in a file you're already editing.
- **Do ask before:** schema changes, destructive git ops, spending money.
- "commit" → stage relevant files + commit. "push" → git push.

## 2. What kinwove is

Grace-first AI Bible study + Christian community app. **Was called "The Way"
until 2026-05-13** when we rebranded to **kinwove**.

- For believers, skeptics, and everyone in between.
- Three core pillars: **AI companion** (Claude-powered Bible/faith Q&A),
  **community** (feed, prayer wall, groups, sermons), **church directory**
  (pastor onboarding + congregation features).
- Aesthetic: **parchment + gold + serif**. Warm, editorial. Not a SaaS dashboard.
- Domain: **kinwove.com** (live). All on **Render** — server.js + built frontend
  both deploy from `main`. Push to main = deploy.

## 3. Stack

- **Frontend:** React 18 + Vite, no framework. Inline styles + `src/theme.js`
  tokens. No Tailwind.
- **Backend:** Express `server.js` — Anthropic proxy, Resend emails, pastor
  onboarding endpoints, rate limiting. All under `/api/*`.
- **DB / auth:** Supabase. Schema in `supabase-schema.sql` + dated migrations
  in `scripts/`. Apply migrations manually in the Supabase SQL editor.
- **AI:** Anthropic SDK, Claude Opus 4.7 (`claude-opus-4-7`). System prompts
  in `src/prompts.js`.
- **Brand:** `KinwoveWordmark` component (`src/components/brand/KinwoveWordmark.jsx`)
  — the proper logo (wordmark + SVG star above the "i"). `KinwoveStar` is the
  raw SVG star. Use these everywhere; never use the `✦` Unicode character as a
  logo substitute.

## 4. Codebase map — the files that matter

/src/ChurchAiChat.jsx         — Pastoral AI chat tab inside ChurchAdmin.
/src/SermonComposer.jsx       — Sermon AI tool. Rendered embedded (tab) inside

/supabase-schema.sql          — Full schema (source of truth).
/scripts/2026-*.sql           — Dated migrations. Newest date = latest.
```

## 5. Pastor onboarding — how it works (critical — read this)

The entire pastor application flow runs **server-side via service role key**.
Never add client-side Supabase calls to this flow — RLS will block them.

### Flow
1. `PastorApply.jsx` form submit → **`POST /api/church/apply`** (server upserts
   to `pastor_applications`, bypasses RLS)
2. Domain-match trigger may auto-approve instantly.
3. Otherwise: user goes to email verification step.
4. **`POST /api/church/submit-unverified`** — creates church row, church_roles
   row (is_owner=true), sets `profile.church_id` AND **`profile.is_pastor = true`**.
5. **`POST /api/church/verify-code`** — same as above, for email-verified path.
6. Self-reported path: "Continue without verifying" button → user manually confirms
   pastor status. Shows success screen with "Go to my dashboard →" button (no auto-dismiss).

### Existing pastors pre-2026-05-23 may need this SQL
```sql
update public.profiles set is_pastor = true
where church_id is not null and (is_pastor is null or is_pastor = false);
```

### `pastorChurchId` — three-layer fallback in `loadChurchRoles` (App.jsx)
1. `church_roles` table (RLS: requires `profile.church_id = church_roles.church_id`)
2. `churches.pastor_id` direct query ("Pastor reads their own church" policy)
3. **`GET /api/me/pastor-church`** — service role, always works regardless of RLS

### `isOwnChurch` (App.jsx church stage)
```js
const isOwnChurch = (pastorChurchId != null && pastorChurchId === viewingChurchId)
  || (profile?.is_pastor && profile?.church_id === viewingChurchId);
```
Second clause handles when `pastorChurchId` is still null on first load.

### `church-admin` stage render guard
```js
stage === 'church-admin' && session && (pastorChurchId || (profile?.is_pastor && profile?.church_id))
```
Uses `pastorChurchId || profile.church_id` as the churchId prop to ChurchAdmin.

### `onGoChurch` nav handler
Opens the church page for everyone, pastors included (changed 2026-08-29 — it used to
drop pastors straight into `church-admin`, which combined with the admin remembering
its last tab meant Church often landed on Settings). The shell's LEADER toggle is
how a pastor gets to the dashboard. Members with `profile.church_id` go to the church
page; everyone else goes to the directory.

### ChurchModeShell (chromeless church page)
When `isOwnChurch=true`, ChurchPage is wrapped in ChurchModeShell showing
the "VIEWING AS LEADER · VISITOR" toggle + tabs.
- "Leader" toggle → `setStage('church-admin')`
- "Visitor" toggle → church public page (current view)
- Community action buttons (Talk to someone / Pray together / Pick a walk)
  are **only** in the `!chromeless` member view — NOT in the pastor's chromeless view.
- Revoke role buttons are hidden on the pastor's own account row.

### Account deletion (`DELETE /api/account`)
Server-side: clears `churches.pastor_id` and removes `church_roles` rows BEFORE
deleting the auth user, to avoid FK cascade ordering failures for church owners.

## 6. Community feed — important gotchas

### Community.jsx has its OWN PostCard
`Community.jsx` contains an inline PostCard component (~line 123–700).
`src/PostCard.jsx` is used by **ChurchPage only**. They are separate.
Always edit the right one.

### Feed scope: personal profile = `scope='me'` only
`Feed.jsx` `me` source query uses `.eq('scope', 'me')`. Church-scoped posts
never appear in the personal profile Posts tab even if the same user authored them.

### Sermon announcement guard (PostCard.jsx)
`isSermonAnnouncement = item.source === 'post' && !!item.body?.is_sermon_announcement`
Blocks delete/edit/hide menus even when `isOwn=true` (pastor is the author).

### Latest Sermon card (ChurchPage.jsx)
Only renders when `latestSermon` exists: `{isPastor && latestSermon && (...)}`.
No empty state shown.

## 7. Design tokens (theme.js)

```
T.gold      #B8733A    T.goldLight  #CC8D52    T.goldDark   #8E5528
T.cream     #F5EDD8    T.parchment  #FAF3E2    T.white      #FFFFFF
T.ink       #1A1108    T.inkSoft    #5A4733    T.inkMuted   #9C7B5E
T.line      rgba(26,17,8,0.12)
T.serif     'Fraunces, Georgia, serif'   (display headings)
T.display   'Newsreader, Georgia, serif' (editorial body text)
T.sans      system sans
T.honey     #D4A24A  (warm amber for stars/accents in dark headers)
```

Post cards: `background: T.parchment`, `border: 1px solid rgba(26,17,8,0.1)`,
`borderRadius: 14`. Body text: Newsreader 17px / lineHeight 1.55 /
`fontVariationSettings: '"opsz" 18'` (critical — without opsz it looks wrong).

## 8. Pending SQL migrations (run in Supabase SQL editor)

```sql
-- 1. Sermon discussion image uploads (posts fail without this column)
alter table public.sermon_discussions
  add column if not exists image_urls text[] default '{}';

-- 2. Rename system DM account display name
update public.profiles
  set display_name = 'kinwove'
  where email = 'system-theway@theway.internal';
```

**Don't rename** `system-theway@theway.internal` auth row — it's not a real
email, it's the trigger anchor for system DMs. Only the display_name changes.

## 9. Open punch list

### Domain + email (when kinwove.app acquired)
- [ ] Point DNS for kinwove.app to Render.
- [ ] Replace `theway.app` → `kinwove.app` in `index.html` (canonical, og:url,
      JSON-LD), `server.js` share links, `public/llms.txt`, `public/sw.js`,
      Plausible `data-domain`.
- [ ] Set `RESEND_FROM` env var on Render (`kinwove <hello@kinwove.app>`).
- [ ] Claim `@kinwove` or `@kinwoveapp` on Twitter, update `twitter:site`.
- [ ] `localStorage` keys (`theway:notes`, etc.) intentionally NOT renamed
      — would wipe existing users' local state.

### Supabase (done — applied 2026-05-26)
- [x] sermon_discussions image_urls column
- [x] profiles.display_name = 'kinwove' for system DM account
- [x] trg_notify_sermon_published trigger (applied 2026-05-27)

### Remaining rough edges
- `PastorDashboard.jsx` SETUP_KEY still uses old `the-way:church-setup:${churchId}`
  localStorage key — intentionally not renamed to avoid wiping existing pastor setup state

## 10. ChurchAdmin tabs

- **Overview** — PastorDashboard (sermon, stats, featured walk picker, care team)
- **People** — PeoplePanel (members, roles, invite code / "Invite your congregation")
- **Ask** — ChurchAiChat (pastoral theology AI, uses `text=` prop on MsgText — NOT `content=`)
- **Bible** — BibleReader (fullBleed mode, topOffset=145 for ChurchModeShell header)
- **Sermons** — SermonComposer embedded (added 2026-05-26, replaces fixed overlay)
- **Settings** — SettingsPanel (church profile, open join toggle, danger zone)
  - Featured Walk was **removed** from Settings (2026-05-24) — it lives in Overview only.

## 11. Tone + voice

- **Grace-first.** Never preachy. Never condescending to skeptics.
- **Honest about uncertainty.** When scripture is divided, say so.
- **No fake enthusiasm.** "Hey friend!" energy is wrong. Calm and adult.
- **Share copy:** must work for believer→believer AND believer→skeptic.

Read `src/prompts.js` for the full canonical AI tone.

## 12. Quick start for the next session

```bash
cd /Users/danielkalawarny/kinwove   # moved off the Desktop 19 Oct 2026 (macOS kept blocking it)
git log --oneline -5        # see recent commits
npm run dev                 # server: localhost:8787, web: localhost:5173
```

Latest commit as of 2026-05-27: `7a4c2a3` — walk card on Sermons tab.
Branch: `main`. Everything is committed and pushed.

Daniel also has a side project — **deconstructors.ca** (demolition company,
SEO/AI overhaul on 10web). Completely separate codebase — don't confuse the two.
