    question: 'How do I keep my congregation engaged between Sundays?',

    answer:
      'The gap is not attention, it is continuity. Most people leave on Sunday with a real question and no way to keep pulling the thread before it fades by Tuesday. What works is giving them somewhere to take the question during the week, not sending them more content.',
    body: [
      { h: 'The problem is Tuesday, not Sunday',
        p: 'Almost nobody disengages during the sermon. They disengage on Tuesday, when the thing that landed on Sunday meets a week that has no room for it. By the time the next Sunday comes around, the thread is gone and you start again. More announcements and more posts do not fix that, because the issue is not that people forgot. It is that they had nowhere to put what they were thinking.' },
      { h: 'A question travels further than a reminder',
        p: 'One honest question from Sunday, asked again midweek, does more than a devotional nobody opens. It gives someone a reason to think rather than a thing to consume. And the answers tell you something a headcount never will: what your people are actually wrestling with, in their words, while it is still live.' },
      { h: 'Most of what people want to ask, they will not ask you',
        p: 'Not because they distrust you, but because asking the pastor makes a doubt official. People will type a question at eleven at night that they would never raise in a foyer. A church that gives them a private place to ask is not competing with pastoral conversation. It is usually the thing that leads to one.' },

    answer:
      'Most people who leave hurt do not leave loudly. They step back from serving, then from attending, then they are gone, and the first real conversation about it never happens. What helps is making it possible to stay connected without having to stage a confrontation first.',
    body: [
      { h: 'They rarely tell you the real reason',
        p: 'The stated reason is usually a scheduling change or a season of busyness. The actual reason is often something smaller and sharper: a comment, being overlooked, carrying too much for too long without anyone noticing.

      { h: 'The door back has to be low',
        p: 'Someone who left hurt will not book a meeting with the pastor. They might read something. They might ask a question anonymously at midnight.

    answer:
      'Deconstruction is usually not a rejection of Jesus. It is the collapse of a particular account of him, often one that was over-certain. The fastest way to lose someone is to answer questions they have not asked yet, and the surest way to keep them is to let the questions stay open longer than is comfortable.',

      { h: 'Early pushback loses them permanently',
        p: 'Someone who has started asking hard questions has usually been asking them privately for a long time before you hear one.

      { h: 'It is usually a person, not an argument',
        p: 'Very few people deconstruct because of a book.

    answer:
      'For research and preparation, it is a reasonable tool and a fast one. For anything that speaks to your congregation in your name, the risk is not that it writes badly. It is that it writes confidently about things it has got wrong, and nobody checks.',
    body: [
      { h: 'The real failure mode is confident invention',
        p: 'A language model will produce a quotation from a commentator who never wrote it, in the right register, with the right cadence. It does not sound uncertain when it is wrong.

      { h: 'Preparation is a different question from proclamation',
        p: 'Using AI to find every place a word appears, or to summarise four views on a passage before you pick one, is closer to a concordance than to ghostwriting. Using it to produce the sermon is a different act, and worth being honest with yourself about which one you are doing.' },
      { h: 'Your people will ask it anyway',

    question: 'Is the resurrection of Jesus real?',
    category: 'Faith & Doubt',
    updated: '2026-07-06',
    answer:
      'There is no way to prove the resurrection like a lab experiment, but it rests on unusually early evidence: eyewitness reports circulating within a few years, followers who died rather than recant, and a movement that exploded around one claim, that a crucified man was seen alive. You can weigh it honestly without pretending it is simple.',
    body: [
      { h: 'The evidence is earlier than most people assume',
        p: 'The claim was not a legend that grew over centuries. In 1 Corinthians 15, Paul passes on a creed most scholars date to within a few years of the crucifixion, naming specific people who said they saw Jesus alive, most still living when he wrote. Whatever you conclude, you are dealing with early testimony, not distant myth.' },
      { h: 'The behavior of the first followers is hard to explain away',
        p: 'The disciples went from hiding in fear to publicly proclaiming a risen Jesus, and many were killed for refusing to take it back. People die for things they believe are true. They rarely die for something they know they made up. That does not prove they were right, but it means they were not simply lying.' },
      { h: 'Honest doubt is welcome here',
        p: 'You do not have to arrive at certainty to explore this. Thomas doubted out loud in a room full of believers and was not shamed for it. He was invited to look closer. If you are weighing the evidence with real questions, you are exactly the kind of person this was written for.' },

    category: 'Suffering & Evil',
    updated: '2026-07-06',
    answer:
      'Christianity does not give a tidy formula for why suffering happens, but it makes two claims: that a world with real love requires real freedom, which can be misused, and that God did not stay distant from pain. He entered it. The answer it offers is less an explanation and more a presence in the middle of it.',
    body: [
      { h: 'The honest starting point: it does not fully explain it',
        p: 'The Bible never hands you a clean equation for suffering. The book of Job spends dozens of chapters refusing easy answers. If someone tells you Christianity solves the problem of pain neatly, they are overselling it. What it offers is different, and, for many people, deeper.' },
      { h: 'Love requires freedom, and freedom can be misused',
        p: 'A world where people can genuinely love is a world where they can also genuinely harm. You cannot have one without the possibility of the other.

      { h: 'God did not watch from a distance',
        p: 'The central Christian claim is not that God explains suffering from far away, but that he stepped into it: betrayed, tortured, and killed.

      { q: 'Is it okay to be angry at God about suffering?', a: 'Yes. The Bible is full of people crying out honestly, the Psalms especially. Bringing your anger to God is treated as a form of relationship, not rebellion.' },

    answer:
      'Doubt is not the opposite of faith — certainty is not required to begin. Throughout the Bible, people believe and question at the same time.

Honest questions are treated as part of the journey, not a barrier to it.' },
      { h: 'You do not have to start with certainty',

    updated: '2026-07-06',
    answer: `Prayer is simpler than most people think: it is just honest talking to God in your own words. You do not need special language, a certain posture, or the right feelings. You can start with a single sentence: even "God, I don't know if you're there, but I'm listening." That counts.`,
    body: [
      { h: `There is no formula to get right`, p: `Prayer is not a spell with magic words. Jesus actually warned against long, showy prayers and taught a short, plain one as a model. If you can talk, you can pray.` },
      { h: `Start honest, not polished`, p: `You do not have to sound religious or hide how you actually feel. The Psalms are full of raw, unfiltered prayers: anger, fear, doubt, joy. God is not waiting for eloquence. He is after honesty.` },
      { h: `A simple way to begin`, p: `Find a quiet minute and say what is true: what you are grateful for, what you are afraid of, what you need. Then listen for a moment. That is prayer, and you can do it anywhere.` },

    answer: `Becoming a Christian is not about cleaning up your life first or passing a test. At its core it is a turning: trusting that Jesus is who he said he is, that his death covers your wrongs, and asking him into your life. It can be as simple as an honest prayer, meant sincerely.`,
    body: [

    answer: `There is no single knockdown proof of God, but there are real reasons people find persuasive: that anything exists at all, that the universe is finely tuned for life, that we have a deep sense of right and wrong, and that longing for meaning is nearly universal.

    updated: '2026-07-06',
    answer: `Christianity's answer is that you were made on purpose, by a God who loves you, to know him and to love others, and that your life has weight beyond what you produce or achieve. Meaning is not something you have to manufacture alone; it is something you were built for and can be found.`,
    body: [

    answer: `Christianity does make an exclusive claim, that Jesus is the way to God, which can sound arrogant. But it is less a boast about Christians being better and more a claim about what Jesus uniquely did: opened a door none of us could open ourselves. It is worth understanding before dismissing.`,
    body: [

    answer: `The Bible speaks to anxiety often, and never with shame. Its repeated message is: you are not carrying this alone, so hand it over. "Do not be afraid" appears more than any other command. Not because life isn't hard, but because God promises to be with you in it. An invitation to release, not a rebuke for feeling it.`,

    answer: `Forgiveness is not saying what happened was okay, forgetting it, or forcing reconciliation.

    answer:
      `Christianity's central claim is that the cross was not an accident but a rescue: Jesus willingly took on himself the weight of human wrong so that forgiveness could be real rather than pretended. Justice and mercy meet there: sin is taken seriously, and people are loved anyway. His death absorbs what we could not fix ourselves.`,
    body: [
      { h: `Forgiveness always costs someone something`, p: `When someone wrongs you deeply and you forgive them, you absorb the cost. The debt does not vanish, you carry it.

      `The Bible treats grief as love with nowhere to go: real, heavy, and nothing to apologize for. Jesus himself wept at a friend's grave even knowing what came next.

      `The Bible does not use the word addiction, but it knows the experience intimately: doing the thing you hate, being mastered by what promised freedom.

    answer:
      `Baptism is the ancient, physical way Christians go public with faith, going under water as a picture of an old life buried, coming up as a picture of new life begun. Jesus was baptized and told his followers to be. It does not earn salvation, which is by grace, but it marks and celebrates it, like a wedding ring on a marriage.`,
    body: [
      { h: `A funeral and a birth in one motion`, p: `Paul says in baptism you are "buried with Christ and raised with him." Going under the water enacts the death of the old you; rising enacts resurrection. It is theology you can feel, which is precisely why Jesus gave his followers something physical to do, not just something mental to believe.` },
      { h: `It is the going-public moment`, p: `In the early church, baptism was how you crossed the line visibly, the point where private belief became public identity, witnessed by a community that now walked with you. That is still its power. Faith can begin invisibly in a heart, but people are embodied, and commitments become real to us when they are enacted in front of others.` },
      { h: `The thief on the cross settles the "requirement" anxiety`, p: `A criminal dying next to Jesus believed and was promised paradise that day. No baptism possible. Salvation is by grace through faith, full stop. So baptism is not a toll gate; it is obedience and celebration. If you believe, the New Testament's assumption is simply: why wait?` },

    answer:
      `The Bible treats marriage as sacred and divorce as a tearing God never wanted for anyone: while explicitly acknowledging real grounds like unfaithfulness and abandonment, and never treating divorced people as second-class. If you are divorced or facing it: God's grace is not reduced for you, and safety from abuse is never unfaithfulness.`,
    body: [
      { h: `What Jesus actually said, and why`, p: `Asked about divorce, Jesus pointed back to the beginning, two becoming one flesh, and called divorce a concession to hardened hearts, not the design. His seriousness was protective: in his world, discarded wives were left destitute. He named unfaithfulness as grounds; Paul later added abandonment. The Bible is realistic that some marriages die.` },
      { h: `Divorce is not the unforgivable sin`, p: `Somewhere along the way, church culture treated divorce as a permanent stain, which scripture never does. God himself is described in Jeremiah as having divorced unfaithful Israel. The metaphor would be impossible if divorce made someone untouchable. Divorced people served, led, and belonged in the early church, and they belong now.` },

    answer:
      `The Bible grounds your worth in something no failure, follower count, or opinion can touch: you are made in the image of God, known before birth, and valued enough that Christ died for you. Your worth is conferred, not earned, which means it also cannot be un-earned. That is a foundation, not a mood.`,
    body: [
      { h: `Worth by design, not by performance`, p: `The Bible's first claim about you is Genesis 1: made in the image of God.

This one was settled before you did anything at all.` },
      { h: `The price tag argument`, p: `In any market, worth is what someone will pay. The Christian claim is staggering on exactly this point: God judged you worth the cross.

    updated: '2026-07-09',
    answer:
      `Rest is not a reward for finishing. It is a rhythm God built into creation and modeled himself. The Bible commands a day off (Sabbath), shows Jesus napping in boats and withdrawing from crowds, and diagnoses hurry as a spiritual problem, not a virtue. "Come to me, all you who are weary" is a standing invitation.`,
    body: [
      { h: `Rest is in the design, not the fine print`, p: `God rests on the seventh day of creation. Not from exhaustion, but to establish a rhythm. Sabbath later becomes one of the Ten Commandments, sitting alongside "do not murder." Scripture takes rest that seriously. A culture that treats exhaustion as a status symbol is arguing with the design specs of being human.` },
      { h: `Jesus was never in a hurry`, p: `Read the Gospels for pace: Jesus sleeps through a storm, withdraws to lonely places while crowds are still asking for him, and walks everywhere.

      { h: `Burnout is often a theology problem`, p: `Underneath chronic overwork is usually a belief: it all depends on me. Sabbath is a weekly protest against that lie.

    answer:
      `Look for three things: the Bible taught honestly, people who are warm before they know what you can offer, and grace at the center rather than performance. Visit a few: churches differ widely in style, and style is preference, not doctrine. You can just walk in on a Sunday. Nobody expects you to know anything.`,
    body: [
      { h: `What actually matters (and what doesn't)`, p: `Music volume, building size, and dress code are taste. What matters: Is scripture taught seriously and honestly? Is grace the message, or is it pressure and performance? Do people seem genuinely glad you exist? A small church with warm people beats an impressive one where you stay anonymous, unless anonymity is what you need at first, which is also okay.` },
      { h: `Your first visit, demystified`, p: `You can arrive a few minutes early, sit near the back, and just watch. Singing is optional.

Give a church two or three visits before deciding; one odd Sunday happens everywhere.` },
      { h: `Why bother with church at all`, p: `Because faith was never designed to be practiced alone. The New Testament's word for church means assembly.

    answer:
      `1 Enoch is a real ancient Jewish text, visions of angels, judgment, and a coming "Son of Man", written centuries before Jesus. It was never hidden or banned: most Jewish and Christian traditions weighed it and did not include it in Scripture, though the Ethiopian Orthodox Church still does. Jude even quotes it.`,
    body: [
      { h: `What the book actually is`, p: `1 Enoch is a collection of Jewish writings from roughly the third century BC onward, attributed to the Enoch of Genesis 5 who "walked with God." Its most famous sections describe angels ("Watchers") who abandoned heaven, the giants that followed, cosmic journeys, and a glorious "Son of Man" who judges the earth. It was widely read in the centuries around Jesus. Fragments were found among the Dead Sea Scrolls.` },
      { h: `It was weighed, not hidden`, p: `The internet loves the idea of "books the church banned," but the history is less cinematic. Ancient communities knew Enoch well and most concluded it was valuable but not Scripture. It never appears in the Hebrew Bible's canon lists, and the early church largely reached the same judgment. The Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church is the notable exception: its canon includes 1 Enoch to this day. Different shelf, not a locked vault.` },
      { h: `Why it still matters for readers of the 66 books`, p: `Jude 1:14–15 quotes 1 Enoch directly, and the New Testament's world, its language about angels, judgment, and the Son of Man, is easier to understand when you know what people were reading at the time. You can take Enoch seriously as history without treating it as doctrine.

      { q: `Is it wrong to read the Book of Enoch?`, a: `No. Many pastors and scholars read it for historical background. The key is reading it as an ancient witness to what people believed, not as a basis for doctrine, the same way you might read other writings from the period.` },
      { q: `Why does Jude quote it if it isn't Scripture?`, a: `Quoting a text approvingly doesn't make the whole text Scripture, Paul quotes pagan poets in Acts 17. Jude cites a line his readers knew to make a true point about judgment.` },

    question: 'Why won’t my congregation use the church app we pay for?',
    category: 'For Pastors',
    updated: '2026-10-06',
    answer: 'Usually because most church apps are broadcast tools: announcements, giving, sermon audio. There is nothing for a member to do during the week. People open an app that answers a real question at 11pm, or lets them pray for someone by name. Adoption follows usefulness, not features.',
    body: [
      { h: 'Most church apps talk, they do not listen', p: 'A feed of announcements, a giving button and last week’s sermon are things you push at people. None of them gives a member a reason to open the app on a Tuesday. An app people actually use answers something, or lets them do something, when they are alone and thinking about their faith.' },
      { h: 'The week is where faith is lived, and where the app has to earn its place', p: 'Sunday is covered. The question a member sits with is on Wednesday, when the sermon has faded and the week has no room for it. An app that meets them there gets opened. One that only repeats Sunday does not.' },
      { h: 'Start with what a person needs, not what the church wants to send', p: 'A place to ask a hard question privately, a prayer wall where their name is actually seen, the week’s sermon turned into something to chew on. These pull people back. Push features (notices, campaigns) do not, however well built.' },
      { h: 'Free removes the other barrier', p: 'A paid app the church bought still has to be worth the member’s time. A free one they can simply try lowers the cost of the first open to nothing, which is where adoption actually starts. kinwove is free, and built around what a member does midweek rather than what the office sends out.' },

    answer: 'Most small churches need three things, not a platform: a way to talk between Sundays, a prayer wall, and sermon follow-up. You can have all three free.

    body: [
      { h: 'Name what you actually need first', p: 'The big church platforms bundle twenty tools because they sell to large staffs.

      { h: 'Small is an advantage here', p: 'A small church can get everyone onto something simple in a week, which a large one cannot. Start with the free pieces, prove people use them, and add paid tools only where a real task is still being done by hand.' },

    answer: 'The usual problem is that every request routes through one person: you. A shared prayer wall and a small care team spread the load, so people are prayed for and followed up without the whole weight landing on the pastor. You stay in it; you just stop being the only one in it.',

    category: 'For Pastors',
    updated: '2026-10-06',
    answer: 'You cannot shepherd someone you only meet once a week in a crowd. The shepherding happens in the week, in the small moments a Sunday service has no room for: a question they can ask, a prayer they can share, a place they are seen. The goal is not more services, it is a way to be present between them.',

    answer: 'Jesus called it blasphemy against the Holy Spirit: a settled, final rejection of God, attributing the work of his Spirit to evil. If you are worried you have committed it, that worry is itself strong evidence you have not. The hardened heart it describes does not lie awake afraid it has gone too far.',

He says it to religious leaders who watched him heal and called it the work of the devil, looking straight at God’s goodness and naming it evil, with their eyes open.' },
      { h: 'Why the fear is the clue', p: 'The sin describes a heart so hard it no longer wants God and feels no pull toward him. Someone afraid they have committed it is grieved, wants to be forgiven, and is reaching toward God. That very desire is the opposite of the hardness Jesus named. The worry is the evidence against the worst.' },
      { h: 'This is often anxiety, not theology', p: 'Many people tormented by this question are dealing with fear, scrupulosity or a harsh picture of God more than an actual act.

// /sermon-prep all returned the SPA fallback — a pastor who received an outreach
// email and looked kinwove up landed on "You don't have to have it figured out
// to belong here", which tells them nothing about what is being offered to them.
//
// Deliberately does not lead with sermon writing. AlignedAI gives that away free
// to 4,600+ pastors and monetises donation processing; competing on their
// strongest, cheapest feature is a bad trade. What kinwove has that they do not
// is somewhere a congregation's actual doubts can go.

    <h1>The questions your people are not asking you</h1>
    <div class="answer">Most of what someone is wrestling with never reaches the foyer. Not because they distrust you, because asking the pastor makes a doubt official. kinwove gives them somewhere to ask it at eleven at night, honestly, and usually that is what leads to a conversation with you rather than replacing one.</div>

    <h2>What it is</h2>
    <p>A place your congregation can take a hard question and get a straight answer: grounded in scripture, willing to say "I don't know", and built for people who are doubting or new rather than people who already speak the language. Around that sits a prayer wall, a feed for your church, and somewhere the week between Sundays can go.</p>

    <h2>What it is not</h2>
    <p>It is not a sermon writer. There are several good ones and kinwove is not trying to be another. It is not church management, giving, or a website builder. It does not hand you a dashboard of what your congregation has been confessing at midnight. Those conversations belong to the people who had them.</p>

    <h2>Why a pastor might want it</h2>
    <p>Because the discipleship problem is Tuesday, not Sunday. People leave with something real and by midweek it has been crowded out, and nothing in a normal church app is built for the moment they wanted to keep pulling the thread. A question asked honestly midweek does more than a devotional nobody opens.</p>
    <p>And because some of your people are already typing their hardest questions into an AI tonight. That is happening whether or not a church is involved. The only open question is whether anything in that conversation points back toward a real person in a real church.</p>

    <blockquote>Now the Berean Jews were of more noble character than those in Thessalonica, for they received the message with great eagerness and examined the Scriptures every day to see if what Paul said was true.<span class="ref">Acts 17:11</span></blockquote>

    <h2>Honest about where this is</h2>
    <p>kinwove is young. It is in free beta, it is not taking money from churches, and it does not yet have a congregation using it at scale. You would be early, with everything that means both ways. If that is the wrong stage for your church, that is a completely reasonable read.</p>
    <p>What that also means: if you tell us what your people actually need, it can still be built around that.</p>

    <h2>Questions</h2>
    <div class="faq">
      <h3>Is this a sermon writing tool?</h3>
      <p>No. This is about the six days after the sermon rather than the writing of it.</p>
      <h3>What does it cost?</h3>
      <p>Nothing while kinwove is in beta. No card, no trial clock.</p>
      <h3>Do I see what my congregation asks?</h3>
      <p>No. Their conversations are theirs. You see the prayer wall, and what people choose to post.</p>
      <h3>How much setup is it?</h3>
      <p>A few minutes for a church page and a join code. After that it mostly runs without you.</p>
      <h3>What do you do with people's data?</h3>
      <p>kinwove stores no IP address and does no location tracking. Conversations belong to the person who had them.</p>
